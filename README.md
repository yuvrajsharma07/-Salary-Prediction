 Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the salaries of employees based on various features such as years of experience, education level, job role, and location. By applying machine learning techniques to historical data, the model helps estimate potential salaries, which can assist HR professionals, job seekers, and analysts in making informed decisions.

The dataset used contains information about employees from various industries and job positions. We preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values. Afterward, we trained multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and RÂ² score.

The Random Forest model showed the best performance and was chosen as the final prediction model. An interactive web app was also built using Streamlit, allowing users to input their data and get real-time salary predictions.
